Massage therapy has been practiced for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt, China, and Greece. Hippocrates, the “Father of Medicine,” even prescribed massages for healing! Today, science backs up what people have known for centuries—regular massages provide amazing health benefits.

Here are five reasons to make massage a part of your wellness routine:

### 1. Reduces Stress & Anxiety

Did you know that **just one massage can lower cortisol levels by up to 31%**? Lower cortisol means less stress, better mood, and improved mental clarity. Massage also boosts serotonin and dopamine—your brain’s natural “happy” chemicals—helping you feel more balanced and relaxed.

### 2. Relieves Muscle Tension & Pain

Many people turn to massage for **back pain relief**, and for a good reason. Studies show that regular massage reduces chronic pain and even improves posture by releasing tension in tight muscles. It’s a natural, drug-free way to feel better!

### 3. Improves Circulation & Boosts Healing

Massage increases **blood flow by 10-15%**, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to your muscles, helping them heal faster. This is why athletes and people recovering from injuries often get massages as part of their recovery plan.

### 4. Supports Better Sleep

If you struggle with insomnia, massage can help! It promotes **deep relaxation** and triggers the parasympathetic nervous system, which tells your body it’s time to rest. Many people report falling asleep during their massage—and sleeping better afterward.

### 5. Enhances Overall Well-Being

Beyond muscle relief, massage therapy can boost your **immune system** by increasing white blood cell production, which helps fight illness. It also lowers blood pressure and promotes overall relaxation, keeping you healthier in the long run.
