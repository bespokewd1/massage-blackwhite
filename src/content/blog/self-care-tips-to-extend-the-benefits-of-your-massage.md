A great massage doesn’t just make you feel amazing—it sets the stage for better well-being. But how can you keep that **post-massage feeling** lasting longer? Follow these simple self-care tips to make the most of your session.

### 1. Stay Hydrated

Massage releases toxins from your muscles, and **drinking plenty of water** helps flush them out. Think of it as a “reset” for your body—hydration is key!

### 2. Stretch Daily

Want to prevent soreness and keep your muscles loose? Gentle stretching **prevents stiffness** and keeps your body flexible. Yoga or simple stretches can work wonders!

### 3. Rest & Relax

Avoid intense exercise right after your massage—your body needs **time to heal and absorb the benefits**. Instead, take it easy, breathe deeply, and enjoy the relaxation.

### 4. Take Warm Baths

A warm bath with **Epsom salts** is one of the best ways to relieve tension after a massage. The magnesium in the salts helps **relax your muscles** and reduce any post-massage soreness.

### 5. Schedule Regular Sessions

One massage is great, but the real benefits come from **consistent sessions**. Studies show that regular massages help with **chronic pain, stress management, and flexibility**—so don’t wait too long before your next appointment!
